# Password-Generator-Ch3

## Description
As an employee with a lot of files and data that only company members have access to, I decided to create a program that will randomly generate a strong password to my liking, keeping the company information safe. Using this site will allow me to choose the length of the password along with what characters I want included, but will be completely generated by the computer so it will be less likely to be determined by someone without access. By writing the code for this program, I now have a better understanding as to how Javascript operates, and will be better able to define and use functions, variable, if statements, for loops, and event listeners for future creations.

## Installation
NA

## Usage
After going to the site, there will be a button for you to click to start the password generation process. Clicking this button will prompt you with a message to input how many characters long you want your password to be (8-128). After this, you will be prompted with yes or no questions asking if you would like to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If you input something other than a number in range for the length, or input all "no" for the 4 character options, you will be given an alert message asking you to restart the process. If you follow the guidelines, a new password with the inputs the user gave will be displayed on the page.
